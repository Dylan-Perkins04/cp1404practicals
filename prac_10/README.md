# Practical 10

## Question 1:
Many of my estimates were incorrect and most tasks took longer than I estimated them to take. Overtime my estimations
did improve, especially for tasks where we've done similar code. However, when completely a task for completely new
content my estimations were only slightly better than when I first started doing estimations.

## Question 2:
Performing code reviews for others has taught me the importance of writing clean, well laid out code with appropriate
documentation. This is because majority of the code I reviewed was very confusing upon first inspection, and it was
difficult to understand what each function did without running the program. I believe only two people providing me
feedback for my pracs, so I haven't learned anything specifically, but I do understand the importance of the reviews
because they can point out small errors in your code that you didn't notice.

## Question 3:
I felt like each practical was fair and well written. Two pieces of advice however is to change the week that the
project management task is due, I believe the week it was due I also had two assignments due for my other subjects, and
it was very difficult juggling all three tasks. Also I think the code reviews should be better reinforced as a required
activity, as they are very valuable activities so maybe if they counted towards our grade it would be a good incentive
for people to complete them.
